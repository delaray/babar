Title: Babar: Knowledge Recognition, Extraction and Representation

Abstract: Babar is a research project in the field of Artificial Intelligence. It aims to bridge together Neural AI and Symbolic AI. As such it is implemented in three different programming languages: Clojure, Python and CLOS.

The Clojure component (Clobar) implements the graphical user interface to Babar. Examples of the Clojure Hiccup library and interfacing Clojure to Javacript will be presented. The Python module (Pybar) implements the web crawling and scraping and the Neural Networks aspect of Babar. The Word Embedding and and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) components of Pybar will be described in detail. Finally the Common Lisp module (Lispbar) implements the Symbolic AI aspect of Babar. This latter includes an English Language Parser and Semantic Networks implemented as an in-memory Hypergraph.

We will present each of these components and target individual aspects with code examples. Specifically we will first present the web developments and Neural Networks components. Then the English Language parser will be examined in detail. We will also  present the knowledge extraction aspect and bridge this with the Neural Network component.

Ultimately we will argue what can be termed "Neural AI" and "Symbolic AI" are at not at odds with each other but rather complement each other. In summary Artificial Intelligence is not a question of "brain" or "mind", but rather a question of "brain" and "mind".
