On the topic of Google Search, Pagerank, Semantics and contextual relevancy...

On of the goals of my Babar AI project is to enhance the delivery and presentation of Google Search results.

The screenshot below displaya a table containing the first 90 results of using Google Search on the word "iguana".

The first two results are Wikipedia pages which are actually essentially the same since the most common type of Iguana is appropriately named the "Common Green Iguana" (Iguana iguana).

The third result is the Iguana Cafe in Paris, and kudos to Google for getting the location right as I do in fact live in Paris.

Then we switch to a Youtube video on the extinction threat of the rare Blue Iguana.

Next we're back to the taxonomic aspects of the Green Iguana as provided by Encyclopedia Britanica...

Anyway my point is that if you actually take a close look at the Google Search results there is a noticible lack of coherence at the very least at the presentation level.

Sure you can specify clever keywords that focus your intent and second guess Google Search in order to get a more relevant list of hits on the first page of results. But in that in that case where is the (artificial) intelligence actually coming from?
